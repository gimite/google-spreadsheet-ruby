This library is now part of google_drive gem: https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby

<b>For new code</b>: I suggest to use google_drive gem directly.

<b>For existing code</b>: You can keep using google-spreadsheet-ruby gem. Now google-spreadsheet-ruby is a library which simply does:

  require "google_drive"
  GoogleSpreadsheet = GoogleDrive

and it provides the same API as before.

Note that gimite-google-spreadsheet-ruby at gems.github.com is no longer updated, because github stopped hosting it.
